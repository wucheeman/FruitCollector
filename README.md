# FruitCollector!

## What the project does
This is an implementation of the CrystalsCollector game, done as homework for the February 2018 UNC Coding Boot Camp. It uses pictures of fruit rather than crystals since the author likes to eat more than he does playing with rocks.

## How to get started with the game
You can play the game online at [GitHub Pages](https://wucheeman.github.io/FruitCollector/

## Authors
This game was built and is maintained by Mark Hainline. Help should not be needed, and is not currently available.
